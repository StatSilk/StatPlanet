# StatPlanet
Mobile compatible interactive mapping software used by UN organizations, government agencies, universities and Global 500 companies - now open source. This version comes with a world map, which can be replaced with any map in GeoJSON format. The current version relies on the open source HighCharts library (free for non-commercial purposes) but could also be integrated with other mapping libraries such as Leaflet.
